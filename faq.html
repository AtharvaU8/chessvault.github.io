    <h1>F.A.Q (Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      
      <h1>Q. What is CastleFile, and how does it work?</h1>
      <p>CastleFile is an innovative encryption platform that uses your chess moves to create a unique cryptographic key for securing your files.</p>
      <span>Here's how it works:</span>
      <ol>
        <li>Upload your file.</li>
        <li>Play at least four moves on a virtual chessboard.</li>
        <li>CastleFile captures your sequence of moves and converts it into a cryptographic key using advanced algorithms.</li>
        <li>This key is then used to encrypt your file with AES-GCM encryption.</li>
        <li>When decrypting, the same chess moves are required to recreate the cryptographic key and access the file.</li>
      </ol>
      <span>CastleFile ensures that security is fun, interactive, and impossible to guess.</span>
      
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. Why are chess moves used instead of passwords or PINs?</h1>
      <p>CastleFile leverages chess moves because they are dynamic, personal, and nearly impossible to predict. Unlike traditional passwords, which can be guessed or brute-forced, a sequence of chess moves introduces randomness and creativity. This approach eliminates vulnerabilities associated with static passwords while adding a unique, personal touch to encryption.</p>
      <span>Additionally, the sequence of moves is long and complex enough to act as a secure cryptographic key, making it ideal for encryption purposes.</span>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. What is AES-GCM encryption, and why is it used?</h1>
      <p>AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode) is a highly secure and widely trusted encryption method used by governments, financial institutions, and tech companies worldwide. It combines robust encryption with authentication, ensuring that your data remains confidential and untampered.</p>
      <span>CastleFile uses AES-GCM because it provides:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>High Security: Resistant to most forms of attack.</li>
        <li>Speed and Efficiency: Ideal for encrypting and decrypting large files quickly.</li>
        <li>Authentication: Ensures the integrity of encrypted data during transmission or storage.</li>
      </ul>
      <span>This combination guarantees that your files remain safe without compromising on speed or usability.</span>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. Does CastleFile store my encryption key or data?</h1>
      <p>No, CastleFile does not store your encryption key or any of your data. The encryption key is generated dynamically based on your chess moves and is never saved on CastleFile’s servers. This zero-knowledge approach ensures complete privacy, meaning only you can access your encrypted files.</p>
      <p>CastleFile also does not store the files you upload. Once the encryption or decryption process is complete and the file is downloaded, it is removed from the system, prioritizing user privacy.</p>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. What happens if I forget my chess moves?</h1>
      <p>If you forget the exact sequence of chess moves used during encryption, you will not be able to decrypt your file. CastleFile relies entirely on the recreation of your original moves to generate the same cryptographic key.</p>
      <p>To avoid this, CastleFile allows you to copy and save your sequence of moves before clicking the encrypt button. It is highly recommended to store your move sequence securely, as there is no way to recover your file without it.</p>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. How secure is CastleFile compared to traditional encryption methods?</h1>
      <p>CastleFile is as secure, if not more secure, than traditional encryption methods. By using chess moves to generate cryptographic keys, CastleFile ensures that every key is highly unique and random. This makes it immune to common vulnerabilities like brute-force attacks or phishing attempts, which often exploit weak or reused passwords.</p>
      <p>The integration of AES-GCM encryption adds another layer of security, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity of the data. Overall, CastleFile combines innovative and proven methods to deliver unparalleled security.</p>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. Can CastleFile be used for both personal and professional purposes?</h1>
      <span>Yes, CastleFile is designed for versatility. It can be used for:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal Use: Encrypting sensitive photos, documents, and other personal files.</li>
        <li>Professional Use: Securing confidential business data, contracts, or intellectual property.</li>
      </ul>
      <span>Its user-friendly interface makes it accessible to everyone, from tech enthusiasts to those with little technical knowledge.</span>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. What file types and sizes can CastleFile handle?</h1>
      <p>CastleFile supports most common file types, including documents (PDF, DOCX), images (JPEG, PNG), videos (MP4, AVI), and more. While there is no universal size limit, the platform is optimized for files up to a few hundred megabytes. Larger files may take longer to process, depending on your internet connection and device.</p>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. Is CastleFile compatible with mobile devices?</h1>
      <p>Yes, CastleFile is compatible with mobile devices and can be accessed through any modern web browser, including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. The platform is optimized for both desktop and mobile interfaces, ensuring a seamless experience regardless of your device.</p>
      <p>Mobile users can upload files, play chess moves, and download encrypted or decrypted files with ease.</p>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. How is CastleFile different from other encryption tools?</h1>
      <p>CastleFile stands out from traditional encryption tools due to its unique use of chess-based encryption. Unlike password-based systems, it transforms your chess gameplay into a cryptographic key, adding an element of creativity and personalization to file security.</p>
      <span>Other key differentiators include:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Zero-Key Storage: CastleFile does not store encryption keys, ensuring absolute privacy.</li>
        <li>Interactive Process: The use of chess makes encryption engaging and memorable.</li>
        <li>High-Level Security: By integrating AES-GCM encryption, CastleFile delivers top-tier protection for sensitive data.</li>
      </ul>
      <span>CastleFile isn’t just a tool—it’s a reimagination of how encryption can be secure, fun, and user-centric.</span>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. Can I share my encrypted files with others?</h1>
      <p>Yes, you can share your encrypted files, but the recipient will need to know the exact chess moves you used to encrypt the file. Without this sequence, the file cannot be decrypted. This ensures that only intended recipients can access the file, maintaining its security during transfer.</p>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="q">
      <h1>Q. Is CastleFile free to use?</h1>
      <p>CastleFile currently offers its encryption and decryption services free of charge. It’s a part of the platform’s mission to make innovative and secure file protection accessible to everyone. Future updates may introduce premium features, but the core functionality will remain free.</p>
