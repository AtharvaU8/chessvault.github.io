Castle File: chess-based file encryption stands out as an innovative, interactive, and user-customizable approach to securing data, where each encryption session is as unique as the game that produces it.

### File Encryption Process via chess

The encryption relies on a combination of cryptographic methods and the unique game mechanics of chess. Here’s a deep dive into how the files get encrypted:

1. Understanding the Encryption Process
	- Step 1: The user starts a game on the chessboard and makes at least a minimum 4 moves. Each move modifies the board’s state.
	- Step 2: The sequence of moves is captured and converted into a cryptographic key.
	- Step 3: The generated key is then used in a standard encryption algorithm.

2. Example Process
	- User Move Sequence: e2e4, g8f6, d2d4, ...
	- Concatenate moves into a string e2e4g8f6d2d4..., hash it with SHA-256 to produce a 256-bit key.
	- Encrypt the file using AES-256 with CBC mode, applying the generated key to scramble the file data.

### Safety and Security

- The encryption key depends on the sequence of moves, makeing it unique and hard to replicate.
- Hash function SHA-256 for Encryption Key Generation.
- AES with CBC mode for File Encryption. 
  
### Privacy 

- The website does not store the key or move sequence.
- This website is completely client side
- If user forget their exact sequence of moves, they lose the ability to decrypt.
